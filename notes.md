# Auth Notes

## Objectives

- implement secure password storage
- implement authentication using sessions and cookies
- use sessions to protect resources
- use a database to store sessions

### Implement secure password storage

Never store passwords in plain text, hash them instead

password --> hashing function --> hash

Hash passwords before they're stored in the database

> When using sessions, the information is saved in the server
> The cookie only needs the session id






try auth0 or okta for authentication
